// Contains heuristics to resize the heap, i.e. expand or shrink, during operation.
//
// For young collections, this heuristics is based on gc time ratio, i.e. trying to
// change the heap so that current gc time ratio stays approximately the one
// selected by the user.
//
// The heuristics tracks both short term and long term behavior to effect heap
// size change.
//
// Short term tracking is based on short-term gc time ratio behavior: for this we
// record events for when actual gc time ratio is outside the range of
// [GCTimeRatio * G1MinimumPercentOfGCTimeRatio, GCTimeRatio] or not in a counter.
// If below that range, we decrement that counter, if above, we increment it.
//
// The intent of this mechanism is to filter short term events as heap sizing has
// some overhead.
//
// If that counter reaches the MinOverThresholdForExpansion we consider expansion,
// if that counter reaches -MinOverThresholdForShrink we consider heap shrinking.
//
// While doing so, we accumulate the difference to the midpoint of this range to
// guide the expansion/shrinking amount.
//
// Further, if there is no short-term based resizing event for a "long" time, we
// decay that counter, i.e. drop it towards zero again to avoid that previous
// intermediate length short term behavior followed by a quiet time and a single
// short term event causes unnecessary resizes.
//
// Long term behavior is solely managed by regularly comparing actual long term
// gc time ratio with the boundaries of above range in  regular long term
// intervals. If current long term gc time ratio is outside, expand or shrink
// respectively.
//
// For full collections, we base decisions only on Min/MaxHeapFreeRatio.
